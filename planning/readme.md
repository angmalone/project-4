# Project 4

## Idea

This app will be used to help people in Fallout 4. Specifically it will allow them to keep track of all the different playthroughs they've done, help them break terminal passwords and help them max out happiness at settlements they built.

## Models

There will be one model, a _Character_ model.
Properties: Name, Build Type, Weapons, Perks and Faction (but this could totally change)

## User Stories

* As a User I will be able to keep a log of all the different characters I've created
* As a User I will be able to enter possible terminal passwords given to me by the game
* As a User I will be able to input my password guesses and have the application guess the correct password
* As a User I will be able to input the statistics of a settlement
* As a User I will be able to manipulate the of the settlement and find out how to increase happiness

### MVP

* Terminal Hacker
* Happiness Calculator

### Bronze

### Silver

* Raider Happiness Calculator (This really won't be difficult it's just I haven't been able to find a good equation for it but I don't want to spend a lot of time looking for it)

### Gold

* Game Map
