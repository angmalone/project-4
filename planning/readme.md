# Project 4

## Idea

This app will be used to help people in Fallout 4. Specifically it will allow them to keep track of all the different playthroughs they've done, help them break terminal passwords and help them max out happiness at settlements they built.

## Models

There will be one model that is a _Character_ model.
Properties: Name, Build Type, Weapons, Perks and Ending (but this could totally change)
